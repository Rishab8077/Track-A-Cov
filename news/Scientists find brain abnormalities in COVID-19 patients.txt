Before, when we saw this in small groups we weren\u0027t sure if this was just a coincidence, but now we can confidently say there is a connection,\" said Zulfi Haneef, assistant professor of neurology at Baylor College of Medicine in the US.\nThe scientists explained that patients are recommended an EEG test when they have a slowed reaction to stimuli, followed by seizure-like events, speech issues, confusion, or an inability to wake up after sedation.\nFrom the review of studies, the researchers said the most common findings from the EEG were slowing or abnormal electrical discharge, mostly in the frontal lobe of the patients.\n\nThey said some of the EEG alterations found in COVID-19 patients may indicate damage to the brain that might not be repaired after recovering from the disease.\nSince the brain cannot regenerate, Haneef cautioned that any damage to the organ will more than likely be permanent.\n\"We know that the most likely entry point for the virus is the nose, so the","description":"Scientists find brain abnormalities in COVID-19 patients.
