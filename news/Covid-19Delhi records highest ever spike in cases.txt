{"title":"Covid-19:Delhi records highest ever spike in cases","body":"\nThe Capital crossed another grim landmark in its fight against Covid-19, reporting over 5,000 new cases of the disease in a day for the first time on Wednesday. Reporting a record new-case count for the second day in a row, the city added 5,673 new cases of the viral infection on the day, after 4,853 new cases on Tuesday.\nOn average, Delhi has now reported 4,225 cases every day in the past week, which means the trajectory has now surpassed the previous peak of 4,174, reported for the week ending September 17, at the height of the second surge.\nDelhi had seen the first surge in cases in June-July, when 3,446 cases were reported in a day at its peak  the week ending June 26.\nAlso Read|\nCovid-19: What you need to know today\nFurther, the positivity rate also went past 9% on Wednesday for the first time since early September.\nThe trend of Covid cases is on a decline across the country.
